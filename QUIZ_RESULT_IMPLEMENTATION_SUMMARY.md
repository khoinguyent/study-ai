### Navigation Flow
1. User completes quiz and clicks "Submit"
2. System evaluates answers and stores result in session storage
3. User is automatically navigated to `/quiz/result/:sessionId`
4. Result page displays score, performance level, and encouraging messages
5. User can "Try Again" (returns to quiz) or "Back to Study" (returns to study session)

## üß™ Testing

### Test File Created
- **File**: `test-quiz-navigation.html`
- **Purpose**: Visual test of result page with different performance levels
- **Usage**: Open in browser to test different score scenarios

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Start a quiz session
2. Answer questions (or leave some blank for lower scores)
3. Click "Submit"
4. Verify navigation to result page
5. Check performance-based styling and messages
6. Test "Try Again" and "Back to Study" buttons

## üîß Technical Details

### Session Storage Keys
- `quiz-result-${sessionId}`: Stores quiz result object
- `quiz-time-${sessionId}`: Stores time spent in seconds

### Result Object Structure
```typescript
{
  scorePercent: number,
  correctCount: number,
  totalQuestions: number,
  breakdown: { byType: {} }
}
```

### Error Handling
- Missing quiz results show error message with "Back to Dashboard" button
- Failed quiz submissions show error toast and remain on quiz page
- Loading states during evaluation process

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

All changes are backward compatible and don't affect existing functionality. The new result page provides a much more encouraging and visually appealing experience for users after completing quizzes.

## üìù Next Steps

1. Test the implementation with real quiz data
2. Verify all quiz components (QuizSession, QuizScreen, OnePageQuizScreen) work correctly
3. Test error scenarios (network failures, missing data)
4. Consider adding analytics tracking for quiz completion rates
5. Potentially add more detailed breakdown of results by question type
