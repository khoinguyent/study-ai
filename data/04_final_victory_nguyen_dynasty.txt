The Final Campaign: Nguyen Anh's March to Victory

By 1802, Nguyen Anh had spent nearly 15 years in exile and resistance, building his forces and waiting for the perfect moment to strike. The time had finally come for his final campaign against the Tay Son, a campaign that would determine the future of Vietnam for over a century.
